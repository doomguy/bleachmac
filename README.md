# bleachmac

`bleachmac` is a bash utility for cleaning up various caches on macOS (and possibly other platforms that run bash).

It has a modular design that allows you to easily add new plugins (PRs are welcome!).

This repo will also collect specialized scripts (in the scrubs folder) to completely wipe specific apps off your hdd.

**Caution: This app will delete files on your machine. Usage is at your own risk! Users are solely responsible for assessing its functionality and associated risks!**
